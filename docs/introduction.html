<p>Data science is a fast growing field with the development of advanced
statistical tools for data analysis and visualization. When the data
volume is large and also when precision is required, we depend on
statistical software to get better insights from the data. Statistical
software makes analysis easy, produces more precise results, enables us
to use complex statistical tools and generates advance complex graphical
outputs.</p>
<p>One cannot blindly depend upon statistical software for data analysis,
as you can use any software for data analysis as per your convenience.
Even some of the basic statistical tools, you can perform calculations
manually. Without proper knowledge in statistics, every software is a
garbage in garbage out. What that really matters is knowledge in
statistical concepts and tools, so that effective interpretations can be
made from the data.</p>
<p>Agricultural experiments demand a wide range of statistical tools for
analysis, which includes exploratory analysis, design of experiments,
and statistical genetics. It is a challenge for scientists and students
to find a suitable platform for data analysis and publish the research
outputs in quality journals. Most of the software available for data
analysis are proprietary or lack a simple user interface. The open
source programming language R and associated ecosystem of packages,
provides an excellent platform for data analysis but as of yet, is not
heavily utilized by researchers in agricultural disciplines.
Insufficient programming and computational knowledge are the primary
challenges for agricultural researchers using R for analysis.</p>
<p>In our sessions, I will be using R studio. I believe that, there is no
need for agricultural scientist and students to learn R as a programming
language, as majority of you would like to have their data analyzed and
make inference from it. I have seen agricultural researchers take up R
workshops and leave it behind as such workshops mainly deals with code
chunks; user will get easily tired of that. Beauty of R is that, it is a
free open-source software. Apart from the software used, I again insist
that students and researchers should strengthen their basic statistics
knowledge and they should be able to decide, what tool should be used
and when. I strongly recommend that you should go through the basic
statistical theory by visiting my e-book <a href="https://kaumelon.github.io/stat3202/">Textbook of Agricultural Statistics</a>. Before proceeding further, one
should also have a basic knowledge about different statistical software
available.</p>

</h2>
<p>Statistical analysis software are specialized programs designed to allow
users to perform complex statistical analysis. These software typically
provide tools for the organization, interpretation, and presentation of
selected data sets. Statistical analysis capabilities refer to
capabilities that support analysis methodologies such as regression
analysis, predictive analytics, and statistical modelling, among many
other basic tools.</p>

</h4>
<p>Open-source software (OSS) is non-proprietary software that allows
anyone to modify, enhance, or simply view the source code behind it. It
can enable programmers to work or collaborate on projects created by
different teams, companies, and organizations. Open-source software
authors do not view their creations as proprietary and instead release
their software under licenses that grant users with the desire and
know-how to view, copy, learn, alter, and share its code.</p>
<p>OSS is shared in a public repository, granting access to anyone who
wants to work on the source code. However, open-source software tends to
come with a distribution license, which establishes how people can
interact, modify, and share the OSS.</p>
<p>Once changes are made to the source code, the OSS should signify those
changes and what methods were used to make them. Also, depending on the
license, the resulting OSS may or may not be required to be free. With
that, most open-source software is free but some require up-front costs
or subscription fees.</p>
<p>Few open source software are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>Rstudio</strong> (GUI interface and development environment for R)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>gretl</strong> – gnu regression, econometrics and time-series library</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JASP</strong> – A free software alternative to IBM SPSS Statistics with
additional option for Bayesian methods</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orange</strong> - a data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics
software</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weka</strong> (machine learning) – a suite of machine learning software
written at the University of Waikato</p></li>

<p>Public domain software is any software that has no legal, copyright or
editing restrictions associated with it. It is free and open-source
software that can be publicly modified, distributed or sold without any
restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dataplot</strong> - It is a public domain software system for scientific
visualization and statistical analysis. It was developed and is

<p>Freeware is software, most often proprietary, that is distributed at no
monetary cost to the end user. There is no agreed-upon set of rights,
license that defines freeware unambiguously; every publisher defines its
own rules for the freeware it offers. For instance, modification,
redistribution by third parties, and reverse engineering are permitted
by some publishers but prohibited by others. Unlike with free and
open-source software, which are also often distributed free of charge,
the source code for freeware is typically not made available. Freeware
may be intended to benefit its producer by, for example, encouraging
sales of a more capable version</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BV4.1</strong>- The application software BV4.1 is an easy-to-use tool for
decomposing and seasonally adjusting monthly or quarterly economic
time series by version 4.1 of the Berlin procedure. It is being
developed by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. The software
is released as freeware for non-commercial purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GeoDa</strong> - It is a free software package that conducts spatial data
analysis, geo-visualization, spatial autocorrelation and spatial
modeling. Maintained from 2016 by Centre for Spatial Data Science
(CSDS) at the University of Chicago, originally developed by Spatial
Analysis Laboratory of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WinPepi</strong> - It is a freeware package of statistical programs for
epidemiologists, comprising seven programs with over 120 modules.</p></li>

<p>It is also known as non-free software or closed-source software, is
computer software for which the software's publisher or another person
reserves some licensing rights to use, modify, share modifications, or
share the software, restricting user freedom with the software they
lease. It is the opposite of open-source or free software. Non-free
software sometimes includes patent rights. Some of the few well known
proprietary statistical software are:-</p>
<p><strong>SAS</strong> - SAS (previously "Statistical Analysis System") is a statistical
software suite developed by SAS Institute for data management, advanced
analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, criminal
investigation and predictive analytics. SAS was developed at North
Carolina State University from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was
incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the
addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the
introduction of JMP.</p>
<p><strong>SPSS Statistics</strong> – SPSS Statistics is a statistical software suite
developed by IBM for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate
analysis, business intelligence, and criminal investigation. Long
produced by SPSS Inc., it was acquired by IBM in 2009. Current versions
(post 2015) have the brand name: IBM SPSS Statistics. The software name
originally stood for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS),
reflecting the original market, then later changed to Statistical
Product and Service Solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Stata</strong> – It is a general-purpose statistical software package developed
by StataCorp for data manipulation, visualization, statistics, and
automated reporting. It is used by researchers in many fields, including
biomedicine, epidemiology, sociology and science. Stata was initially
developed by Computing Resource Center in California and the first
version was released in 1985. In 1993, the company was renamed Stata
Corporation, now known as StataCorp.</p>
<p><strong>Genstat</strong> (General Statistics) - It is a statistical software package with
data analysis capabilities, particularly in the field of agriculture. It
was developed in 1968 by Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom and
was designed to provide modular design, linear mixed models and graphic
functions. It is developed and distributed by VSN International (VSNi),
which is owned by The Numerical Algorithms Group and Rothamsted
Research.</p>
<p><strong>Minitab</strong> – Minitab is a statistics package developed at the Pennsylvania
State University by researchers Barbara F. Ryan, Thomas A. Ryan, Jr.,
and Brian L. Joiner in conjunction with Triola Statistics Company in
1972. It began as a light version of OMNITAB 80, a statistical analysis
program by National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p><strong>MATLAB</strong> – MATLAB an abbreviation of "MATrix LABoratory" is a
proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing
environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations,
plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation
of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other
languages.</p>
<p><strong>EViews</strong> – EViews is a statistical package for Windows, used mainly for
time-series oriented econometric analysis. It is developed by
Quantitative Micro Software (QMS). EViews can be used for general
statistical analysis and econometric analyses, such as cross-section and
panel data analysis and time series estimation and forecasting. EViews
combines spreadsheet and relational database technology with the
traditional tasks found in statistical software, and uses a Windows GUI
(Graphical User Interface).</p>
<p>For agricultural researchers I recommend using RStudio for data
analysis, as it is easy to use. RStudio allows users to develop and edit
programs in R by supporting a large number of statistical packages,
higher quality graphics, and the ability to manage your workspace. We have developed a R package <code>grapesAgri1</code> for agricultural research. We will be discussing this package towards last session. To read more on please see <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03437">grapesAgri1</a></p>
