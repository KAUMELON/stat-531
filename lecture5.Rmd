# Packages and libraries  

## Packages
Packages are organised collections of R functions, data, and compiled code. There are two type of packages in R.  

## Standard packages
Standard packages come pre-installed with R installations and are regarded as being a part of the R source code. The fundamental R functions are found in base packages, which make it possible to perform common statistical and graphical operations on datasets. Examples of standard packages include `stats`, `graphics`, `grDevices`, `utils`, `datasets`, `methods` and `base`. The functions available in these standard packages can be used for basic operations on the data set. Some of the functions we have discussed earlier in Section\@ref(rbase), like `mean()`,`min`, `log10`,`as.data.frame` etc
